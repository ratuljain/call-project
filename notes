Phone number is a text field -
Are you going to add/subtract/multiply/divide Phone Numbers?Nope. Similarly to SSNs, Phone Numbers are discrete pieces
of data that can contain actual numbers, so a string type is probably most appropriate.
In an int column, the 0 will be stripped of, which makes the phone number invalid.
